            <h1>Professional Summary</h1>
            <p>
              
I am a seasoned leader in large organisations with 20+ years’ experience in change management, 
systems thinking, learning and organisation development, product development and project management. 
I have a unique combination of expertise in management, technology, operation, training design and 
has deep experiences working with governments.
                <p>

                </p>
One of my key accomplishments was leading the SAF's (Singapore Armed Forces’) Learning Transformation 
which saw the courses in 20 SAF training institutions become more learner-centric, leveraging mobile devices, 
enterprise IT, and e-learning content. I am familiar with a wide array of technologies, 
ranging from military equipment, weapon and command control systems, enterprise IT systems, Learning Portal, 
Learning Management System, data analytics, simulation and gaming technologies including virtual and augmented reality. 
Additionally, I have extensive experience working with procurement agencies, government agencies, foreign militaries, 
industries, engineers (hardware, software, human factor engineers), academia and consultants.

My key strength is in the ability to marry up new technology with management to transform organizations.
